### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Deeply fascinated by the World of Science, Singing Aficionado, Avid Fan of Badminton and a Tech Savvy.
Presently, enrolled in Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineering (GenEng) program and delving into an array of Programming Languages. Currently honing my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python with an ultimate goal of becoming proficient and evolving into a Full-Stack Developer.
My professional voyage began with a 100% academic scholarship opportunity in Birmingham. Which helped in refining my abilities and establishing the groundwork for my forthcoming pursuits. For the past three years, Iâ€™ve been immersing myself in the dynamic world of Freelance Content Writing across various platforms like Upwork etc. Additionally, I assist candidates in preparing for various English Language Proficiency Exams including IELTS, as well as specialist entry exams such as OET and PTE.
Having finished my O level and A level with a penchant for Genetics. I intend to pursue a degree in Biomedical Science at a prestigious university in England.
Beyond this in 2019, I achieved a significant milestone by winning a Discrimination Case at SEND Tribunal Darlington, UK - A testament to my determination and advocacy for fairness and equality achieved at the tender age of 15!
I'm excited to explore new opportunities, leverage my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and collaborate to inspire a positive change and innovation!
